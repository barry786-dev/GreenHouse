                    Our project is all about the problems faced by people when they go out of their home and have
                    less time for taking care of their plants. This project helps people in such time and they can
                    trigger or check status of their plant from anywhere.

                    The system monitors temperature and humidity of the place, and soil moisture of the ground,
                    waters the plant remotely, then saves all data to DynamoDB through AWS IoT. Collected data is
                    visualized by different charts and figures to give better understanding of conditions where the
                    plant thrives.

                        What’s the best way to celebrate Earth Day? By planting something, of course. Whether
                        you were inspired by Courtney Barnett or a desire to fight the man, growing your own
                        plants is as enjoyable as it is rewarding. Today, there is an abundance of gardening

                        Plants are one of the most fascinating and important groups of organisms living on
                        Earth. They serve as the conduit of energy into the biosphere, provide food, and shape
                        our environment.
